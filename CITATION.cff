      Kokkos 3: Programming Model Extensions for the
      Exascale Era
repository-code: 'https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos'
url: 'https://kokkos.org/'
abstract: >-
  As the push towards exascale hardware has increased the
  diversity of system architectures, performance portability
  has become a critical aspect for scientific software. We
  describe the Kokkos Performance Portable Programming Model
  that allows developers to write single source applications
  for diverse high-performance computing architectures.
  Kokkos provides key abstractions for both the compute and
  memory hierarchy of modern hardware. We describe the novel
  abstractions that have been added to Kokkos version 3 such
  as hierarchical parallelism, containers, task graphs, and
  arbitrary-sized atomic operations to prepare for exascale
  era architectures. We demonstrate the performance of these
  new features with reproducible benchmarks on CPUs and
  GPUs.
